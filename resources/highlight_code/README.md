# Highlighting Code Helpers
This directory contains the styling and `js` code needed to highlight code in `html` files.
To generate the `html` file containing all the highlighted code example , open the `scripts` folder and run `generate_highlighted_code.py`.
This utility will then extract all the code from all the files ending with `.ct` from this directory, which will then be written highlighted in `highlighted_codes.html`, in the root project directory.
